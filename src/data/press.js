      "Another year is drawing to a close; and we once again find ourselves planning for the future, but also reflecting on the events of 2020 – we hope that despite the difficulties and uncertainty this year has brought, you have managed to stay strong and focused on the things you can control. In that manner, Enterprise League has continued to work hard on connecting businesses worldwide. Our focus has always been to bring more business opportunities to small businesses. Thus, seeing how severely they suffered due to the pandemic, our drive to improve the platform, and provide them with better solutions, only grew stronger. \n\n Thanks to nearly 100k new companies that joined the platform (a big milestone for us!) we got an unprecedented growth momentum which consequently brought us a humbling number of opportunities.\n\nThis success didn’t pass unrecognised – we had the privilege of being named as one of the best business platforms by the Business Insider.\n\nLead by the same currents of growth, this year we have formed deeper relationships with both new and old users, expanded our partners’ circle, and scaled our team.\n\nAs we reflect, we think about who we are and who we want to be, both personally and as a company. A commitment to quality and value is one of our fundamental business principles, we firmly believe in excelling in what we promise and deliver.\n\n What we’re most proud of this year is that we’ve managed to provide the same high level of service and solutions to all companies, regardless of their background. Given that, we seek to make our solutions easily accessible – keeping the lines of communication open in order to help our users with their platform experience. We are committed to combine courage and wisdom to move forward; confidently pursuing growth and investment while not abandoning our values.\n\nIt is our hope that these things have all been clearly evident in the past year, and that they continue into the future. Finally, we once again express our sincere appreciation to all of our users, readers and collaborators; wishing you and your families a bright hopeful start to 2021.",
